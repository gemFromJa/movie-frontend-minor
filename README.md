### Highlight something in your project that you thought was especially interesting or significant to your overall implementation.

I built the demo to be predominantly server-side, which allowed me to take advantage of caching while simplifying the handling of query-based requests. This approach improved performance and made the data flow easier to manage.

### Tell us what you are most pleased or proud of with your implementation.

I’m most pleased with how smooth the reauthentication flow is. The current structure makes it straightforward to extend existing functionality or add new features without significant refactoring.

### Given more time, what next feature or improvement would you like to add to your project?

Given more time, I would add search autosuggestions. I believe this would improve the user experience by helping users find relevant content more quickly and reducing friction during searches.
